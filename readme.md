# BFV

BFV is fully homomorphic encryption library that implementas [HPS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/117.pdf) RNS variant of BFV (Brakerski/ Fan-Vercauteren) scheme. The library intends to be performant and comparable to existing C/C++ FHE libraries with support for BFV scheme.

There's no plan, as of yet, to add support for other FHE schemes (ex, CKKS). But we are open to changing our minds.

Checkout [examples](./bfv/examples/) to get started or projects like [Oblivious message retrieval](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/ObliviousMessageRetrieval) and [ULPSI (Unbalance labelled private set intersection)](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/ulpsi) to get a sense of how to use the library.

> [!NOTE]
> Open to better name suggestions!

### Features

To enable serialization and deserilization of types enable `serialization` feature. You also ensure that you have Protoc buffer compiler with version >= 23.4 installed. If not, you can install it from [here](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/#binary-install).

By default `std` feature is enabled and uses [concrete-ntt](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ntt) as the default NTT backend.

You may enable `nightly` feature to enable `nightly` feature of [concrete-ntt]() that accelartes NTT operation on machines with AVX512 instruction set. Make sure to switch to nightly compiler before enabling `nightly`.

With `hexl-ntt` (only on x86) you can swap out [concrete-ntt]() NTT with NTT backend that uses [hexl](https://github.com/intel/hexl).

With `hexl` (only on x86) you can accelerate modulus operation using [hexl](https://github.com/intel/hexl).

For best performance on x86 either use (1) `hexl-ntt` and `hexl` together OR (2) `nightly` and `hexl` together.

Note that both `concrete-ntt/nightly` and `hexl-ntt` use AVX512 instruction set to accelerate NTT operations and their performance does not differ.
